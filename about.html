      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>My name is Eli Iliria.</p>
      <p>I am a senior at Bentonville High School and a first year student in the Global Business Strand of the Ignite Professional Studies program. I am currently a Food Runner and Expediter at Mirabellaâ€™s Table, an Italian restaurant, and I am also a Strategic Retail Consulting Intern at GNV, a retail advisory firm.</p>
      <p>I love to travel, eat new foods, and see all sorts of places. I have been to 23 countries so far, and my favorite country has been Switzerland. A few summers ago, I did 5-week work and study abroad in Costa Rica. Volunteering and working helped me to develop my communication skills and cross cultural awareness. Last fall, I applied for and got accepted into a 10-week intensive language initiative program sponsored by the Department of State.</p>
      <p>I am interested in studying abroad or taking a gap year before or during college. I want to learn other languages and gain some more international experience.</p>
